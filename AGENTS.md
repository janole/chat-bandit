## Monorepo Overview

This document provides an overview of the monorepo, its structure, and key components.

### Project Description

This project is an open-source, privacy-focused desktop AI assistant that supports both local and cloud AI models. It integrates with local LLMs such as Ollama and llama.cpp and cloud providers including OpenAI, Google AI, and OpenRouter.

### Repository Structure

The project uses a monorepo approach with a clear separation between applications and shared packages.

-   **`apps/`**: Contains the user-facing applications.
    -   **`electron/`**: The main desktop application, built with Electron and React.
    -   **`landing-page/`**: The project's landing page, built with Next.js.
-   **`packages/`**: Contains shared code and libraries used across the applications.
    -   **`ai-core/`**: Core AI logic and type definitions.
    -   **`ai-chat/`**: React components and hooks for the chat interface.
    -   **`ai-electron/`**: Electron-specific backend and IPC (Inter-Process Communication) code.
    -   **`basic-app/`**: Primitive UI components and layout utilities.
    -   **`try-catch/`**: A utility package (details unspecified).
-   **Configuration Files**: The root directory also contains important configuration files for the entire monorepo, such as `turbo.json` (for Turborepo), `eslint.config.mjs` (for ESLint), and `tsconfig.base.json` (for TypeScript).
